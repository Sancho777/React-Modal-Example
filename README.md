# React Modal Example

This is a simple React application that demonstrates how to create a modal dialog box. The app includes a text input and a button. The button is disabled when the text input is empty. When the button is clicked, a modal window appears displaying the entered text. The modal can be closed by clicking outside of the window, and the input field is cleared upon closing.

## Features

- Text input with a button that is disabled when the input is empty.
- Modal window that displays the text entered in the input field.
- The modal can be closed by clicking outside of it.
- Input is cleared when the modal is closed.
- Styled using Tailwind CSS.
